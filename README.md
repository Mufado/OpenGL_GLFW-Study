# OpenGL Study Repository (utilizing GLFW library)
My first encounter with OpenGL. This is where I learn and study about OpenGL using GLFW library (all development is divided by chapters in branches)

Implementation and learning process are based in this website: https://learnopengl.com

Thanks to Joey de Vries to make it possible!
